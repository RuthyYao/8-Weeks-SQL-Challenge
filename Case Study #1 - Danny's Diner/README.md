## Bussiness Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, 
  not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

#### Bonus Questions
1. Join All The Things - Create a table that has these columns: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N).
2. Rank All The Things - Based on the table above, add one column: ranking.

### Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```TSQL
SELECT
  sales.customer_id,
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_spend
FROM sales 
JOIN menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
```
|  customer_id | total_spend  |
|---|---|
|A	|76|
|B	|74|
|C	|36|

### Q2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
```TSQL

|---|---|
|A	|4|
|B	|6|
|C	|2|

  
---
### Q3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
```TSQL
WITH order_rank_cte AS(
	SELECT 
		sales.customer_id,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date ASC)  -- DENSE_RANK assign the same rank to rows with equal value without gaps, resulting in consecutive ranks.
			AS order_date_rank,
		menu.product_name
	FROM sales
	JOIN menu 	
		ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)
SELECT 
	customer_id,
    product_name,
    COUNT(product_name) AS quantity_ordered
FROM order_rank_cte
WHERE order_date_rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;  -- If the product was ordered twice, GROUP BY ensures it will return only one row, avoid duplicate in the output.
```
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | curry        |
| A           | sushi        |

		AS quantity_sold_rank
FROM sales
JOIN menu 
	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,

### Q6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
```TSQL
WITH orderAfterMember AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    mn.product_name,
    s.order_date,
    m.join_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rnk
  FROM sales s
  JOIN members m 
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  JOIN menu mn 
    ON s.product_id = mn.product_id
  WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  product_name,
  order_date,
  join_date
FROM orderAfterMember
WHERE rnk = 1;

```
| customer_id | join_date  | product_name | order_date |

  	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date DESC)
  		AS order_date_rank
FROM sales
LEFT JOIN members 
	ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
LEFT JOIN menu
  	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE sales.order_date < members.join_date
  )
SELECT 
	customer_id,
    	join_date,
    	product_name,

### Q9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
Note: Customers earn points when they make purchases only after they become members.
```TSQL
WITH customer_points AS (
	SELECT
	 sales.customer_id,
    	 sales.order_date,
    	 menu.product_name,
    	 menu.price,
    	 (CASE
    		WHEN sales.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM members) AND menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * menu.price * 10
     		WHEN sales.customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM members) AND menu.product_name != 'sushi' THEN 1 * menu.price * 10
        	ELSE 0
    	END) AS points
	FROM sales
	LEFT JOIN menu
		ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
